   ```
   E:\MJ-Ahmad\src\MJUI\

## 🌐 Deploying on GitHub Pages

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository (e.g., `mjui-dashboard`).
2. Upload the **contents of your MJUI folder** (not the zip itself).
3. Commit the changes.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
6. Save — GitHub Pages will deploy your site.

- Ensure `index.html` is in the root folder.
- Keep the folder structure intact (`docs/assets/logo.png` must stay in place).
- To update your site, commit and push changes — GitHub Pages auto-updates.
- For a custom domain, configure it under **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
